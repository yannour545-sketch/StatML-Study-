Example 1: System of 2 Equations, 2 Unknowns

Consider the system:

2x - y = 0
-x + 2y = 3


1. Row Picture (Graphical Interpretation)

Each equation represents a line in the 2D plane.
- Line 1: `2x - y = 0` → passes through origin with slope 2.
- Line 2: `-x + 2y = 3` → rewritten as `y = (x+3)/2`.

The solution is the intersection point of these two lines: `(x=1, y=2)`.

(Diagram shows two intersecting lines with the point (1,2) marked.)

2. Matrix Form

We can write the system as `A * x = b`:


[ 2  -1 ] [x]   [0]
[ -1  2 ] [y] = [3]


Where:
- `A` is the coefficient matrix.
- `x` is the vector of unknowns `[x, y]`.
- `b` is the right-hand side vector `[0, 3].


3. Column Picture (Vector Interpretation)

We ask: Can we find scalars `x` and `y` such that a linear combination of the columns of `A` equals `b`?


x * [2]  +  y * [-1]  =  [0]
    [-1]       [2]      [3]


This means: `x * (column 1) + y * (column 2) = b`.

- Column 1: Vector `[2, -1]`
- Column 2: Vector `[-1, 2]`
- Target Vector `b`: `[0, 3]`

From the solution `(x=1, y=2)`:

1 * [2]  +  2 * [-1]  =  [2 - 2]  =  [0]
    [-1]       [2]      [-1 + 4]     [3]


The linear combination works!

(Diagram shows vectors in 2D space: column 1, column 2, and their combination reaching `b`.)*



Example 2: System of 3 Equations, 3 Unknowns

Consider the system:

2x - y         = 0
-x + 2y - z    = -1
    -3y + 4z   = 4
```

Matrix Form


A = [ 2  -1   0 ]
    [-1   2  -1 ]
    [ 0  -3   4 ]

b = [ 0 ]
    [-1 ]
    [ 4 ]

x = [x]
    [y]
    [z]


So, `A * x = b`.



1. Row Picture (3D Interpretation)

Each equation represents a plane in 3D space.
- The solution is the point where all three planes intersect.
- In this case, the intersection point is `(x=0, y=0, z=1)`.

(Diagram shows three intersecting planes in 3D space.)


2. Column Picture (3D Vector Interpretation)

We ask: Can we find `x`, `y`, `z` such that:

x * [2]  +  y * [-1]  +  z * [0]  =  [0]
    [-1]       [2]        [-1]      [-1]
    [0]        [-3]       [4]       [4]


Let’s test the solution `(x=0, y=0, z=1)`:

0 * [2]  +  0 * [-1]  +  1 * [0]  =  [0]
    [-1]       [2]        [-1]      [-1]
    [0]        [-3]       [4]       [4]

 It works!

(Diagram shows the three column vectors in 3D space and how their linear combination reaches `b`.)


Key Question: Can we solve `Ax = b` for every `b`?

This depends on whether the columns of A span the entire space (in this case, ℝ³).

For our 3x3 matrix `A`:
Do the linear combinations of the columns fill 3D space?

 Answer: Yes, for this matrix A.

This means that for any vector `b` in ℝ³, there exists a solution `x` such that `Ax = b`. This property is equivalent to saying that the matrix `A` is *invertible* (or non-singular).
